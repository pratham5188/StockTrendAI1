# StockTrendAI - Bugs and Issues Fixed

This document summarizes all the bugs, errors, and problems that were identified and fixed in the StockTrendAI application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: None of the required Python packages were installed, causing the application to fail on startup.

**Solution**: 
- Installed `uv` package manager
- Installed all dependencies from `pyproject.toml` using `uv sync`
- All major packages now available: pandas, numpy, plotly, streamlit, scikit-learn, xgboost, yfinance, etc.

### 2. TensorFlow Compatibility Issue (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: TensorFlow 2.14.0+ does not support Python 3.13, causing dependency installation failures.

**Solution**:
- Replaced TensorFlow with Keras 3 + JAX backend
- Updated `models/lstm_model.py` to use Keras 3 with JAX backend
- Added proper fallback mechanism when deep learning libraries are unavailable
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to include `keras>=3.10.0` and `jax[cpu]>=0.5.0`

### 3. LSTM Model Import Issues
**Problem**: LSTM model was configured to use TensorFlow which wasn't available.

**Solution**:
- Modified `models/lstm_model.py` to detect and use available deep learning backend
- Added automatic fallback to simplified implementation when Keras/JAX unavailable
- Set `KERAS_BACKEND=jax` environment variable for optimal performance

### 4. Python Command Not Found
**Problem**: System had `python3` but not `python` command available.

**Solution**:
- All scripts and commands now use `python3` explicitly
- `uv run` ensures correct Python environment is used

### 5. Development Environment Setup
**Problem**: No easy way to start the application.

**Solution**:
- Created `run_app.sh` script for easy application startup
- Script handles environment setup and starts Streamlit server
- Made script executable with proper permissions

## Verification

All functionality has been tested and verified:

✅ **All imports successful** - All modules import without errors
✅ **Data fetching works** - Can retrieve stock data from Yahoo Finance
✅ **Technical indicators work** - SMA, RSI, MACD calculations functional
✅ **Models initialize** - Both XGBoost and LSTM models can be created
✅ **Streamlit app starts** - Application launches successfully

## Current State

The application is now fully functional with:
- All dependencies properly installed
- Deep learning capabilities via Keras 3 + JAX
- Robust error handling and fallbacks
- Easy startup via `run_app.sh` script

## How to Run

1. **Option 1 - Using the startup script:**
   ```bash
   ./run_app.sh
   ```

2. **Option 2 - Manual startup:**
   ```bash
   source $HOME/.local/bin/env
   uv run streamlit run app.py
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501` (or `http://0.0.0.0:5000` depending on configuration).

## Dependencies Summary

### Core Libraries
- pandas (data manipulation)
- numpy (numerical computing)
- plotly (interactive charts)
- streamlit (web framework)

### Machine Learning
- scikit-learn (traditional ML)
- xgboost (gradient boosting)
- keras (deep learning with JAX backend)
- jax (numerical computing backend)

### Financial Data
- yfinance (stock data)
- textblob (sentiment analysis)

### Database & Storage
- sqlalchemy (database ORM)
- psycopg2-binary (PostgreSQL driver)
- alembic (database migrations)

All issues have been resolved and the application is ready for use.
