# Timeframe Analysis Fix

## Problem
When users changed the timeframe period in the application, it would not properly trigger fresh analysis and predictions. The application would sometimes use cached predictions or data that didn't correspond to the new timeframe.

## Root Causes
1. **Incomplete Cache Key**: The prediction cache key only included stock symbol, period, and data length, but didn't account for model selection changes
2. **Data Cache Issues**: The data fetcher had its own caching system that wasn't being cleared when timeframes changed
3. **Missing Model Selection Tracking**: Changes in model selection (XGBoost/LSTM) weren't properly tracked for cache invalidation
4. **Edge Cases**: When different timeframes resulted in the same data length, predictions weren't regenerated

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Prediction Cache Key (`app.py`)
- **Before**: `data_key = f"{stock}_{period}_{len(data)}"`
- **After**: `data_key = f"{stock}_{period}_{use_xgboost}_{use_lstm}_{len(data)}_{data_hash}"`
- Added model selection flags to cache key
- Added data hash of recent indices to detect data content changes
- Added tracking of model selection changes

### 2. Improved Cache Invalidation
- Added session state variables to track model selections:
  - `last_xgboost_selection`
  - `last_lstm_selection`
  - `last_data_key`
- Clear all relevant caches when stock or period changes
- Force prediction regeneration when model selection changes

### 3. Data Fetcher Cache Management (`utils/data_fetcher.py`)
- Added `clear_cache_for_symbol(symbol, period)` method
- Added `clear_all_cache()` method
- Clear data fetcher cache when timeframe changes to force fresh API calls

### 4. Better User Feedback
- Show "Refreshing analysis..." message when timeframe changes
- Show "Generating fresh predictions..." message when predictions are recalculated
- Clear visual indicators when analysis is happening

### 5. Enhanced Refresh Button
- Manual refresh now clears all caches (session state + data fetcher)
- Forces complete data and prediction refresh

## Technical Details

### Session State Variables Added:
```python
if 'last_data_key' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.last_data_key = None
if 'last_xgboost_selection' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.last_xgboost_selection = None
if 'last_lstm_selection' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.last_lstm_selection = None
```

### Cache Invalidation Logic:
```python
# Force recalculation if:
# 1. Predictions are None
# 2. Data key changed (stock, period, models, or data content)
# 3. Model selection changed
if (st.session_state.predictions is None or 
    getattr(st.session_state, 'last_data_key', None) != data_key or
    getattr(st.session_state, 'last_xgboost_selection', None) != use_xgboost or
    getattr(st.session_state, 'last_lstm_selection', None) != use_lstm):
```

### Data Hash Implementation:
```python
import hashlib
data_hash = hashlib.md5(str(stock_data.index[-10:].tolist()).encode()).hexdigest()[:8]
```
Uses last 10 data points' timestamps to detect data changes.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Timeframe Changes**: Changing timeframe now triggers:
   - Data cache clearance
   - Fresh API data fetch
   - New prediction generation
   - User feedback showing refresh status

2. **Model Selection Changes**: Changing XGBoost/LSTM selection triggers:
   - Prediction regeneration without refetching data
   - Cache invalidation for predictions only

3. **Manual Refresh**: Refresh button now:
   - Clears all caches
   - Forces fresh data from API
   - Regenerates all predictions

## Testing Recommendations

1. Change timeframe and verify fresh analysis happens
2. Toggle model selections and verify predictions update
3. Use manual refresh and verify complete refresh
4. Check that appropriate user feedback messages appear
5. Verify different timeframes show different data/predictions

## Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact during normal usage
- Slight increase in processing time when caches are invalidated (expected)
- Better user experience with clear feedback
- More accurate predictions based on correct timeframe data
