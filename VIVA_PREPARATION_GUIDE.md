## 🤖 **SECTION 2: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE & MACHINE LEARNING**

### **AI Models Questions:**

5. **How many AI models did you implement and what are they?**
   - **Answer:** 7 AI models:
     - XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)
     - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
     - Prophet (Time Series Forecasting)
     - Ensemble (Multi-Model Combination)
     - Transformer (Attention-based)
     - GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
     - Stacking Ensemble (Meta-learning)

6. **Explain the difference between LSTM and GRU models.**
   - **Answer:** 
     - **LSTM:** Has 3 gates (forget, input, output), more parameters, better for complex patterns
     - **GRU:** Has 2 gates (reset, update), fewer parameters, computationally efficient, similar performance

7. **What is the Transformer model and how does it work?**
   - **Answer:** Transformer uses self-attention mechanisms to focus on different parts of the input sequence. It processes sequences in parallel rather than sequentially, making it efficient for time series prediction.

8. **Explain the concept of Ensemble Learning in your project.**
   - **Answer:** Ensemble combines predictions from multiple models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks) using weighted averaging or voting to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

9. **What is Stacking Ensemble and how is it different from regular ensemble?**
   - **Answer:** Stacking uses a meta-learner (secondary model) that learns how to best combine predictions from 8 base models, rather than simple averaging. It's more sophisticated meta-learning approach.

10. **Why did you choose XGBoost for your project?**
    - **Answer:** XGBoost is excellent for structured data, handles missing values well, provides feature importance, is computationally efficient, and works well with financial time series data.

### **Deep Learning Questions:**

11. **Explain the architecture of your LSTM model.**
    - **Answer:** Our LSTM has:
      - Input layer for 60-day sequences
      - 3 LSTM layers (128→64→32 neurons)
      - Dropout layers for regularization
      - Dense output layer for price prediction
      - BatchNormalization for stability

12. **What is the vanishing gradient problem and how do LSTM/GRU solve it?**
    - **Answer:** Traditional RNNs lose information over long sequences due to gradients becoming very small. LSTM/GRU use gate mechanisms to control information flow and maintain long-term dependencies.

13. **What activation functions did you use and why?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - **ReLU:** For hidden layers (prevents vanishing gradient)
      - **Tanh:** In LSTM/GRU gates (bounded output)
      - **Linear:** For output layer (regression task)
