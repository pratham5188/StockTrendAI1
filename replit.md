## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

**Frontend**: Streamlit web application with custom CSS styling
**Backend**: Python-based prediction engine with multiple ML models

**Data Source**: Yahoo Finance API for real-time and historical stock data
**Models**: XGBoost for classification and LSTM for time series prediction
**Caching**: In-memory caching for data fetching optimization

## Key Components

### 1. Data Layer (`utils/data_fetcher.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handles stock data retrieval from Yahoo Finance
- **Features**: Automatic NSE symbol formatting, caching mechanism, data cleaning
- **Caching Strategy**: 5-minute cache duration to reduce API calls
- **Data Processing**: Handles missing values, duplicate removal, and date indexing

### 2. Technical Analysis (`utils/technical_indicators.py`)
- **Purpose**: Calculates various technical indicators for stock analysis
- **Indicators Supported**:
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Stochastic Oscillator
- **Design**: Stateless calculator with individual methods for each indicator

### 3. Prediction Models

#### XGBoost Model (`models/xgboost_model.py`)
- **Purpose**: Fast classification-based prediction model
- **Features**: Uses RandomForestClassifier as fallback for XGBoost
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates price ratios, volume trends, and technical indicator combinations
- **Model Persistence**: Pickle-based serialization for model and scaler

#### LSTM Model (`models/lstm_model.py`)
- **Purpose**: Deep learning model for time series prediction
- **Architecture**: Sequential LSTM with dropout layers
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation when TensorFlow is unavailable
- **Data Preparation**: Sequence-based data structuring for time series analysis

### 4. Model Management (`utils/model_utils.py`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized model lifecycle management
- **Features**: Model metadata tracking, evaluation metrics, persistence handling
- **Metadata Storage**: JSON-based metadata with timestamps
- **Directory Management**: Automatic model directory creation

### 5. User Interface (`app.py`)
- **Framework**: Streamlit with custom CSS styling
- **State Management**: Session state for stock selection and caching
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with futuristic neon glow effects
- **Layout**: Wide layout with expandable sidebar

- **Color Scheme**: Neon green and blue gradients on dark background

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: User selects stock → DataFetcher retrieves data from Yahoo Finance
2. **Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators calculated → Additional features created
3. **Model Prediction**: 
   - XGBoost processes engineered features for classification
   - LSTM processes sequential data for time series prediction
4. **Results Display**: Predictions rendered with interactive charts and metrics
5. **Caching**: Results cached to improve performance on repeated requests
